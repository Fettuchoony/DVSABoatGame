Cuidadores de Agua will be a third person action RPG based around the EPA Superfund cleanup of the Lower Duwamish River.  Players will learn about the history of the superfund cleanup and the agencies involved, various industrial and commercial pollution sources, and the impact on the Duwamish Valley Community. The game will center around cleaning different pollutants in the river as the player navigates a boat through 3 levels covering different segments of the river. The first segment will be a tutorial where players will learn to move their boat and dredge to clean up contaminants. The following segments will have special events or sources of pollution. These levels will progressively become more difficult, but yield more pollution credits for the player to upgrade their equipment. The communityâ€™s improving health will be reflected via graphics of community members with improved health and fishing as the environment is repaired.
